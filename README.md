Welcome to my github, I’m Sergio Sáez.

I currently work at iProspect, previously known as Inteligencia YMedia, as Applications Developer. 

During my career I focused in two areas simultaneously:
1) ETL/ELT processes and databases ( Greenplum, postgreSQL and Oracle ) with Node, Java, Talend, shell scripts and Jobscheduler for the YMedia data team, building new modules for their core applications. 
2) The development of the ERP of YMedia with Oracle Application Express, which also allowed me to understand how http/https and front end works and acquire basic knowledge of css and html and learn in order to expand the functionality of Oracle Apex core.
